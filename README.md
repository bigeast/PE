Project Euler by bigeast
=====

This repository contains some of my solutions to [Project
Euler](https://projecteuler.net).

* I start to work on **PE** around 2011 
* My prefer language is C/C++ or Java(for its BigInteger) at first.
* Recently I find Python is convenient.
* And PARI/GP is very suitable to solve PE problems. 
* I also use **Vim**(its visual block mode) and **bc** to find calculate very quickly.
I picked up my progress about a months ago(2014.08), and decied to clean up my old(mess) codes.

Some problems' source code is not available, I'll rewrite them some time in the future.

List all problem ID:
> ls PE*.* | sed 's/PE\([0-9]*\).*/\1/' | sort -n | uniq
